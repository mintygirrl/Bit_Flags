Effort: Two and a half weeks.

Purpose: Apply the structure we learned to the bit_flags code we've
previously written, and practice allocating space and using it, as well as
making sure it's destroyed when we're done with it.

Interface proposal: I think we should add some sort of write in function
were we as the user directly for where they want to set a flag. This could 
be more cost effective and use less lines, as well as streamline the process
without constantly writing out function call after function call.
